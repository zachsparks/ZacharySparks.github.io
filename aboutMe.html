									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Hello, I'm Zachary Sparks, and I'm embarking on a journey to become a Junior Web Developer. Let me share a bit more about who I am and what drives me.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/trail.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>With a solid background in IT, I've spent 5 years working on the IT help desk, where I honed my technical problem-solving skills and developed a 
									customer-oriented approach. This invaluable experience has prepared me for a seamless transition into the world of web development.
									Beyond my professional work, I've been deeply immersed in web development for the past four years. I've had the privilege 
									of designing websites for friends, experimenting with e-commerce solutions through open-source content management systems, 
									and exploring various aspects of web development. For me, web development isn't just a job; it's a genuine passion that I'm excited to bring to life.
								</p>
								<p>When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm an avid outdoor enthusiast. Hiking is a personal favorite of mine, as there's nothing quite 
									like the thrill of reaching a summit or discovering a hidden trail. Nature not only rejuvenates me but also provides the inspiration that often 
									reflects in my web design projects. Additionally, fishing is another cherished pastime. It's the perfect blend of relaxation and patience, qualities 
									that I believe align well with the meticulous nature of web development.
								</p>
								<p>If I had to pick one project that I'm particularly proud of, it would be the React Admin Dashboard. This project embodies my commitment to creating functional,
									 aesthetically pleasing websites that offer an exceptional user experience. My driving force is a blend of ambition and diligence. I'm always pushing myself to 
									 learn and improve. I wholeheartedly believe in the power of web development to make a positive impact, and I'm eager to prove my dedication to potential employers and clients.
								</p>
								<p>I'm excited to connect with fellow developers, prospective employers, and clients who share my passion for web development. Whether you'd like to discuss a project, share hiking stories,
									 or exchange fishing tips, please feel free to reach out. You can contact me at zachary.sparks.solutions@gmail.com or connect with me on Linkedin <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-sparks-3b2880166/">@Zachary Sparks</a>.
									Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio, and I look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead on my web development journey!</p>
